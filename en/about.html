    <p>My name is Raphael Sousa — or at least, that is how I have been designated in the world. But a name is, in essence, a convention; and no convention can capture the mystery of a subject. Records and documents know what I have done: I am a lawyer, Christian, writer, and theologian. But these labels, though legitimate, merely orbit what I am — they do not penetrate me. For what do records know about the being who questions his own existence?</p>

    <p>I graduated in Law from Candido Mendes University (2013), became a Master in Regulatory Law from Fundação Getúlio Vargas (2016), and later earned another Master's degree in Law and Economics from UCAM (2018). I accumulated diplomas — not out of vanity, but thirst. Education, for me, was never ornament; it was a passage. It was the way I found to rebel against what was given, against inherited fate, against the repetition of the Same.</p>

    <p>But none of this, by itself, answers the fundamental question: who am I? And perhaps the most honest answer is: I am an Other — in the full sense of alterity. I always feel like a stranger to myself, and it is precisely because of this that I refuse to be an It, a definable thing, a function, a résumé. I inhabit the tension between the already-been and the not-yet. And it is in this in-between that I breathe.</p>

    <p>I am, therefore, a walking question. A being in gestation. My “am” does not rest — it pulses, escapes, exceeds. I am not interested in fixing myself in essences; instead, I desire to remain open. My being is always yet to come — not as escape, but as fidelity to my own incompleteness. And in that I find power.</p>

    <p>It was education — books, ideas, encounters — that allowed me to think of myself this way: as a becoming that refuses to be reduced to what has already been. They rescued me from automatism, from the thing-world, from the logic of the It. They made me someone capable of seeking the Thou — the living encounter, the true relation, the wonder of Being.</p>

    <p>For this reason, I remain committed — not to a fixed identity, but to the process of inhabiting the world wholeheartedly. I continue writing, thinking, trying. I continue becoming.</p>
